# Wisgen ðŸ”®

A small Cross-Platform Wisdom Generator using [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) and a combination of external APIs

This Wisdom Generator combines random advice from the [Advice Slip API](https://api.adviceslip.com) with vaguely fitting and vaguely thought provoking stock images from the [Unsplash Source API](https://source.unsplash.com/).

### Purpose
I used this project to understand how Flutter handles communication with the web and how it implements asynchronous calls. I also got the chance to better understand how Flutter handels _state_ and how to transfer that _state_ over multiple classes withing the Widget Tree.

### Used Packages
- provider (for state handeling)
- http
- cached_network_image
- flutter_launcher_icons
 
### Some of Sources I can recommend 
- [State handling in Flutter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_m5csmrf7I)
- [Naming Conventions](https://dart.dev/guides/language/effective-dart/style)
- [Code Readability](https://iirokrankka.com/2018/06/18/putting-build-methods-on-a-diet/)
