# Wisgen ðŸ”®

A small Cross-Platform Wisdom Generator using [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) and a combination of external APIs

This Wisdom Generator combines random advice from the [Advice Slip API](https://api.adviceslip.com) with vaguely fitting and vaguely thought provoking stock images from the [Unsplash Source API](https://source.unsplash.com/).

| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|

I am using this project to understand how Flutter handles communication with the web and how it handles asynchronous calls.

### Future Plans
- State Handling through multiple classes
- The option to mark advice as a favorite
- The option to view those favorites
- And the persistent saving of data on the device
