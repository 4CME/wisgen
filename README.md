# Wisgen ðŸ”®

A small Cross-Platform Wisdom Generator, built using [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) and a combination of external APIs

This Wisdom Generator combines random advice from the the Internet with vaguely fitting and vaguely thought provoking stock images from the [Unsplash Source API](https://source.unsplash.com/). 
You can also save bits of wisdom you like in your _favorites_ or share them with your friends.

## Purpose of Wisgen
I used this project to understand how Flutter handles communication with the web and how it implements asynchronous calls. I also got the chance to better understand how Flutter handels _state_ and how to transfer that _state_ over multiple classes withing the Widget Tree.
